# CheckList
A checklist app that saves, loads, and deletes if needed. Made with Tkinter. Instructions will be given.

# How to run
I'm sure there's multiple ways to run this program, but I opened it in Visual Studio Code and ran it that way (yes VS Code can run Python code).

# About this file
Made with Python & Tkinter; I've been wanting to use Tkinter for a while now - glad I learned some tricks.
