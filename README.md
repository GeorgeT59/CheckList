# CheckList
A checklist app that saves, loads, and deletes if needed. Made with Tkinter. Instructions will be given.

# How to run
I'm sure there's multiple ways to run this program, but I opened it in Visual Studio Code and ran it that way (yes VS Code can run Python code).

# About this file
Made with Python & Tkinter; I've been wanting to use Tkinter for a while now - glad I learned some tricks.

Look at the screenshot I provided to see what it looks like.

# Instructions
This program has 5 buttons; pretty self-explanatory, but here goes:

Add Item - Adds whatever item you typed in the text bar above.
Remove Item - Removes the item you added in the big text box below (must select the item to remove).
Clear List - Removes all from the list.
Save List - This will create a txt file in the same directory called 'checklist.txt' with the items you have saved.
Quit - Closes the program.
